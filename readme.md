# zombie-shooter 💥🧟‍♂️🔫

Simple point-and-click webpage zombie shooter, loosely inspired by [Deanimator](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/237765), a flash game I played as a kid, and [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/), a fun rogue-lite on Steam. Coded in 1.5 days as a chill weekend project! Try a live demo [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/chris-p-schneider/zombie-shooter/blob/main/index.html).
